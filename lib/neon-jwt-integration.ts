/**
 * Neon Database and JWT Integration Guide
 *
 * This file provides guidance on integrating JWT authentication with Neon Database's Row-Level Security (RLS).
 *
 * For your current application, you don't need to implement this unless you specifically want to use
 * Neon's Row-Level Security features. Your current JWT implementation is sufficient for authentication
 * in your application.
 *
 * If you decide to implement RLS in the future, here's how you would do it:
 */

import { generateKeyPair, SignJWT } from "jose"

/**
 * Generate RSA key pair for JWT signing and verification
 */
export async function generateKeys() {
  const { publicKey, privateKey } = await generateKeyPair("RS256")

  // The privateKey should be stored securely in your environment variables
  // The publicKey should be uploaded to Neon for verification

  return { publicKey, privateKey }
}

/**
 * Sign a JWT with the private key
 */
export async function signJWT(payload: any, privateKey: any) {
  const jwt = await new SignJWT(payload)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: "RS256" })
    .setIssuedAt()
    .setExpirationTime("7d")
    .sign(privateKey)

  return jwt
}

/**
 * Implementation Steps for Neon RLS:
 *
 * 1. Generate key pair and store private key securely
 * 2. Upload public key to Neon
 * 3. Create RLS policies in your database
 * 4. Modify your JWT payload to include claims needed by RLS policies
 * 5. Use the JWT in your database connection
 *
 * Example RLS policy:
 *
 * CREATE POLICY user_isolation ON users
 * USING (id = current_setting('request.jwt.claims')::json->>'user_id');
 *
 * This would restrict users to only seeing their own data.
